# Auto keys.lol program!
The program automatically searches the keys.lol site for any active wallets and logs them in a file! Multiply the pages read by 128 and you get the amount of bitcoin addresses searched. If you get a large group of computers together and run this program you would eventually stumble upon a private key that you could use.

# Installation
Install python 3.7 and run the Main.py program to start searching for keys. 

# VERSION 1.2 release notes
Improved page number printing with a slight speed up in program execution.
