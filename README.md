# Auto keys.lol program!
The program automatically searches the keys.lol site for any active wallets and logs them in a file! Multiply the pages read by 128 and you get the amount of bitcoin addresses searched. If you get a large group of computers together and run this program you would eventually stumble upon a private key that you could use.

# Installation
Install python 3.7 and run the Main.py program. You could also try your luck and go to: keys.lol and search for keys manually.

## Bitcoin private keys only
The program can be modified to search for eth private keys
